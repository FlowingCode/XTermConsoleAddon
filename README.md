# Developer Guide

## Getting started

Initialize a terminal with autosize, clipboard support and listener:
```
XTerm xterm = new XTerm();
xterm.writeln("Hello world.\n\n");
xterm.setCursorBlink(true);
xterm.setCursorStyle(CursorStyle.UNDERLINE);
    	
xterm.setSizeFull();
xterm.setCopySelection(true);
xterm.setUseSystemClipboard(UseSystemClipboard.READWRITE);
xterm.setPasteWithRightClick(true);

xterm.addLineListener(ev->{
    String line = ev.getLine();
    System.out.println(line);
});	
		
xterm.focus();
    	
xterm.fit();
```

## Special configuration when using Spring

By default, Vaadin Flow only includes ```com/vaadin/flow/component``` to be always scanned for UI components and views. For this reason, the addon might need to be whitelisted in order to display correctly. 

To do so, just add ```com.flowingcode``` to the ```vaadin.whitelisted-packages``` property in ```src/main/resources/application.properties```, like:

```vaadin.whitelisted-packages = com.vaadin,org.vaadin,dev.hilla,com.flowingcode```
 
More information on Spring whitelisted configuration [here](https://vaadin.com/docs/latest/integrations/spring/configuration/#configure-the-scanning-of-packages).

## Special configuration for Vaadin 23.3 and Vaadin 24

Vaadin 23.3 and 24 validate addons sources as part of the build (see vaadin/flow#15485). 
In order to exclude the code in the addons from validation, you need to add the following to tsconfig.json:

```
  "exclude": [
	"frontend/generated/jar-resources"
  ]
```
